http://www.asiaone.com/china/oil-tankers-sinking-china-raises-environmental-fears	Beijing - The sinking of an Iranian tanker off China could severely damage marine life, environmental experts warned Monday, as state media reported an oil spill covering up to 50 square miles at the scene.An oil spill 11.5 miles long and up to 4.6 miles wide surrounded the site as of Monday afternoon, according to the official People's Daily newspaper.Alaska-based oil spill consultant Richard Steiner called the accident "the single largest environmental release of petroleum condensate in history".Even if only 20 per cent of the vessel's cargo was released into the sea, it would still be an amount about equivalent to Alaska's disastrous 1989 Exxon Valdez crude oil spill, he said."The condensate oil, a kind of ultra-light oil on Sanchi, is different than other types of crude oil and is poisonous to marine life," he warned.	93	Oil tanker's sinking off China raises environmental fears 	-1

http://www.asiaone.com/goldman-sachs-advises-cutting-exposure-chinese-property-sector	Chinese property prices may be on a tear, but it's time to pull back on exposure to developers' stocks amid a stockpile of unsold supply, Goldman Sachs said.Despite long-running fears over a potential supply glut, China's property prices have had an inexorable climb.Among the developer stocks, Goldman said it preferred stocks of companies focused on destocking and operational improvement, such as Agile, Shimao and Yanlord.Any improvement in property construction would likely benefit early-cycle commodities, such as cement and steel, first, rather than copper and aluminium, which were exposed to late-cycle demand, it said."The metal most exposed to this, and least exposed to subdued property construction activity, is nickel," it said.	-1	Goldman Sachs advises cutting exposure to Chinese property sector	9

http://www.asiaone.com/asia/taipei-now-its-longest-hot-spell-record	TAIPEI - The mercury in Taipei topped 36 degrees Celsius for the 10th day in a row Monday, making it the longest streak in the city on record.This surpassed the nine-day record set from July 8-16 in 2012 to become the lengthiest Taipei hot spell in the 120 years since the Taipei weather station began making records.There is a chance the record hot spell will continue, said the CWB, which is forecasting more hot days to come this week.The prolonged hot spell has put great strain on Taiwan's power system, which ran on dangerously thin reserve capacities - prompting the issuance of red power supply alerts - in the past week.The Ministry of Economic Affairs, which oversees Taiwan's state-owned electricity company, said Monday that Taiwan would not see another red alert again this summer as long as the power supply system remained stable.	93	Taipei is now in its longest hot spell on record	-1
